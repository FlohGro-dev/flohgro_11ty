## whoami

I am Floh Gro – a 31-year young software developer 👨‍💻 from South Germany 🇩🇪.

In my free time I often go out cycling 🚲️ with a gravel bike or do other sports 🏅. I like to travel 🧳 with our campervan 🚐. In 2024 I got the incredible honor to become a father of our little boy. I love coffee ☕️ and pizza 🍕.

During my studies I deep dived into the productivity topic and tried a lot of apps / techniques / methods to get my sh*t done. I always love to read tips / tricks in related topics (probably more than I should 😂).

I listen to various podcasts 🎙️ and love (loud) music 🎧️, too. I listen to many different genres from Hip-Hop to Dance / Electronics and Rap to Worship – totally depends on my current mood 🍄.
