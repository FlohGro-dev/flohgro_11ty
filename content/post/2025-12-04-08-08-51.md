I had issues with Craft quitting shortly after being unused for a few minutes. I couldn't get my had around what was causing it - it was driving me crazy 🫠. Finally took the time to annoy Claude with log messages from Craft and after (a lot of) back and forth I (re)discovered that I have Raycasts Auto Quits enabled and its closing Craft after 3 minutes 😶‍🌫️.
