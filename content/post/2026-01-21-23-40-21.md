I have A LOT of old documents that I want to scan and store in DEVONthink.
Any recommendations for tools that use local AI to rename files (I really don't want to do that manually - goal is to have a good enough name, DT search with OCR will do the rest).
I already found this https://github.com/wunderkind2k1/ai-pdf-renamer but not a great prompt + model combination right now..
