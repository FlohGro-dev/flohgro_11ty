I was wondering why our HomePods refused to play my playlists in Apple Music with Siri for some time. Finally figured out that this is another issue of living in a multilingual setup of devices. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

![The image displays a notification message on an Apple device. It reads: "The Siri language of 'iPhone' does not match the language of this HomePod. If you turn on Personal Requests, anyone can ask this HomePod for your personal information when 'iPhone' is nearby." Below the message are two button options: "Use Personal Requests Anyway" and "Cancel." The background is dark, highlighting the white text and the orange color of the "Use Personal Requests Anyway" button.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/apple-home-screenshot-for-personal-requests.png)
