I tried to learn developing Apps on & off for years.
Now I'm finally at a point that I want to publish something and looking for a few people willing to provide some initial feedback. The app lets you look back on photos you took on the same date in the past.

If you're interested to get involved, drop me a DM on Mastodon and the first 5-10 people will get an invite ðŸ˜Š
