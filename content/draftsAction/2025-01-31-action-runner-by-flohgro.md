> ## action runner
> 
> Configure an action group and define actions that shall be included or excluded and this action will present you a prompt to select one from the resulting actions. It will run the action afterwards.
> 
> This is useful for the action bar or an action group where you want to combine different actions without making several aliases of them.
> 
> ### [Configuration]
> 
> The action uses the newly introduced (January 2025) “Configure Value” steps. The first time you run the action you will see a prompt that asks you to configure the following values:
> 
> - Action Group Name (required): add the exact name of the Action Group
> - Include Action Names (optional): add names of actions that you want to explicitly include (all others will be ignored)
> - Omit Action Names (optional): add names of actions that you want to explicitly exclude (all others will be included)
> 
> > please note: if you configure both Include and Omit Action Names, only the Include Action Names will be considered.
> 
> If you want to change you’re configuration, long press / right click on the action and select “Configure,…” and the configuration prompt will appear again.
