About a year ago I decided to run an experiment: I stopped wearing my Apple Watch for the majority of the day. Most importantly, it bothered me that it was so distracting for our ~6-month-old boy. He always tried to touch it and play around with it.
Not to mention that the Series 4 is a bit outdated nowadays, the battery was not making it through a day anymore and I was not willing to spend a chunk of money on a new one back then.

I decided to return to an analog watch that my wife gifted me years ago. I loved wearing this watch for many years and when I switched to my Apple Watch I still wore it on special occasions.

More than one year later, I am still happy using the “WATZMANN” watch every day. I missed having the option to quickly glance at the watch to check the temperature and especially setting timers, but other than that it was a calming pleasure without any notifications tapping my wrist anymore. I also think this looks much better than any smartwatch — even if it’s cheaper.

My Apple Watch was demoted to a sleep tracker and more importantly a silent alarm. This is really important for me since I joined the 5am club when our toddler changed our lives. 

I love my morning routine and having some time for myself for Bible study, reading and doing a short workout before them waking up and brightening my day before work.

I used my Apple Watch to track a few hikes but use a Garmin computer to track my cycling activities.
The innovations for the Apple Watch since 2018 (Series 4) are great but until now nothing really convinced me to buy a new one and I am still happy to snap the stainless steel band of the analog watch every morning. Not sure what it would require for me to go back and use an Apple Watch - besides buying a new generation.

Are you still using an Apple Watch or have you made the switch, too?
