After trying [Readwise Reader](https://read.readwise.io) and experimenting a bit with the [Readwise](https://readwise.io) trial I subscribed to the service because its just great ðŸ˜„.

Now I tried to create a few Shortcuts to retrieve Highlights from Readwise and share them to other apps. I personally use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and Readwise has a great official plugin to import the highlights but I couldnâ€™t resist to built the Shortcuts anyways.

Below are the Shortcuts I created. If you have feedback, further requests, or trouble just reach out on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@flohgro). If you like the Shortcuts I would appreciate if you share this post and consider to [support my work](https://flohgro.com/donate/)

## App-Specific Versions

Below are a few App-specific Versions of the Shortcuts above. The exported Highlights will direclty be exported to those apps instead of opening the Share Sheet. If you donâ€™t find the App your using, either modify them yourself or reach out and Iâ€™ll add them.
