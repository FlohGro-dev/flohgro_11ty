After seeing a post by [Robb](https://rknight.me/blog/app-defaults-2026) and [Matt](https://birchtree.me/blog/my-app-defaults-in-2025-a-few-days-late/) - It seems like it is time to update my **App Defaults** list after first doing it in [2023](https://flohgro.com/blog/app-defaults-2023/).
You can check out a huge collections of similar posts [here](https://defaults.rknight.me).

It was pretty interesting to see that I really settled on a lot of apps and did not switch a lot of tools. I added Craft again for notes but besides that there are no big changes. I added a few more categories compared to my last post.
