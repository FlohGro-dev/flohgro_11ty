The theme for the 19th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Color**".

I love going out and enjoying a big chunk of ice cream in the afternoon with my wife (and our little boy). Now that it's getting warmer heading to the summer this is a great thing to do were we have time together. I first wanted to shoot some of the washed out colors in the old town here but when I looked at the cone of ice cream I thought this would be a great fit so here we are looking at three scoops of ice cream: lemon, raspberry and plum (yes I'm a fruit person).

The background is sunlit, with cobblestone pavement and blurred cars, emphasizing the vivid colors of the ice cream.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-19-color.jpeg)
