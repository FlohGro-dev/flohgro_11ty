This shortcut creates a new document in Craft from a configured (markdown) template.

## \[Configuration\]

When you install the shortcut you are prompted to select the space the shortcut should use. It will also ask you for the folder where new documents shall be placed â€“ if you want to have new documents in the inbox just leave that empty.

## \[Usage\]

Use this shortcut to create a template for notes you create on a regular basis (e.g. meeting notes / reading notes). If you want to have different templates you can simply duplicate (and rename) the shortcut for the different use cases.

To create your template just create it in Craft and export the document in markdown format. Copy and paste the markdown export into the text step of the shortcut
