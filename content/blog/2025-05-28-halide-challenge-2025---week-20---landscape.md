The theme for the 20th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Landscape**".

When I read the theme of this week, there was one spot I immediately had in mind. However, when I stopped there and took a shot, I was a bit disappointed. The problem was that the best viewpoint was from a frequently used road, and I didn't want to wait for a better time. So, I went out this morning while riding my gravel bike to take some pictures. Although the weather was pretty bad, I like the view from the tall grass with some red wildflowers, looking down into the wide landscape with the road winding through. The tree on the left provides a nice framing for the view.

A winding road cuts through the fields, leading towards a small cluster of houses nestled near a grove of trees in the distance. On the left side, a large, leafy tree stands prominently, its branches extending towards the cloudy sky. In the foreground, bright red wildflowers add a pop of color amid the lush greenery.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-20-landscape.jpeg)
