The theme for the Nth week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**glass**".

With a shot of my favorite coffee mug not getting the results I wanted and a closed church around that would also be a good fit for the challenge, I took this shot while riding with the bike. The large greenhouse with the reflections of the sky and sunlight made good sense to me, and I tried to capture the size with the perspective while ensuring not to fall off the bike üòù.

Inside, lush green plants of varying sizes thrive in orderly rows, with light streaming through the transparent roof, highlighting the vibrant foliage and the sleek, clear structure of the glass.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-23-glass.jpeg)
