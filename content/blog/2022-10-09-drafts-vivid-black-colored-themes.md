I took some time to adapt @agiletortoise‚Äôs ‚ÄúVivid Dark+‚Äù theme to my personal needs and taste.

The background is changed to true black which is great on OLED displays.

To easily distinguish between different workspaces I use in Drafts I created several versions with different highlight colors. This enables me to use the same theme just differentiated by highlight colors for visual separation üòä
