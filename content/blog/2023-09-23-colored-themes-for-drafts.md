Sometimes you need a fresh paint for apps you use the most. The great thing about [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) is that themes can totally change the look (and feel) of the app especially when you assign them to different workspaces.

Having used my [Vivid Black+ themes](https://directory.getdrafts.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Vivid+Black) for a long time I was in the mood for some more colors in the interface. That’s why I took the time to create a series of c\[olor\]ed themes that I enjoy using for different workspaces to easily distinguish which one is active right now. It started with six themes but I already added a 7th theme to the list after a user in the [Drafts forum thread](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/c-olor-ed-themes/14513?u=flohgro).

Take a look at these great themes
