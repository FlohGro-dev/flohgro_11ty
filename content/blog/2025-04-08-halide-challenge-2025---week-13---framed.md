The theme for the 13th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Framed**".

Looking out through this old window is a true joy once spring arrives and the trees begin to bloom. When the evening sun appeared on that side of the house, I thought this would be a perfect fit for this weekâ€™s challenge. The only drawback is the larger building in the background that inevitably steals some focus. Nonetheless, I like the cropping, the varying brightness, the vibrant colors, and the overall springtime feel captured in this shot.
