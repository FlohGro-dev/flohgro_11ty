The theme for the 14th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**spring**".

The weekend was just perfect for the spring theme; we had really great weather and spent most of the time outside. I took this shot when we enjoyed the afternoon with friends and our godchild at a local playground. The cherry blossom trees were blooming beautifully, and I quite like the perspective from below.
