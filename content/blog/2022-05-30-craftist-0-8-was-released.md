My Craft eXtension for Todoist just got better 👍️

Find all the details below 📝 and download ⬇️ the new release from the GitHub repository:

[https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/Craftist](https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/Craftist)

⚠️ After reinstalling the newest version – make sure to login with your API token again.

Let me know if you like the new release and what you would like to see additionally 📬️. I already have some (challenging) requests in the pipeline but appreciate your feedback 👌

**🆕 tab layout** 🖌️

now the features are separated from the settings and info in tabs to reduce the clutter in the eXtension

The settings are not hidden behind a button anymore – instead they are directly displayed in the corresponding tab

**🆕 Info tab ℹ️ with Version Check ✅**

The new info tab checks if the installed version is the latest available version and displays some informative text.

Thanks to @DharamKapila for the inspiration, help and permission here!

**🆕 Import Tasks with Label 🏷️**

You can now import all tasks with a selected label into the current document / page

To select a label just open the dropdown menu in the new “Import Tasks with Label” button and click on the label whose tasks you want to import

**🆒 setting to exclude tasks assigned to others 🦦**

You can now select if you want to import tasks assigned to others in shared projects or if you just want to import tasks assigned to you or unassigned.

**🆒 shortened links to tasks 🩳**

Links to tasks now use a more compact layout for mobile (App) 📱 and web 🌐 links with emojis. This reduces the clutter and shortenes the displayed text for imported tasks

**🆒 due strings for recurring tasks 🕵️**

The due strings are now imported for recurring tasks – this hopefully simplifies to determine the repeating frequency of a task

**🐛 no importing of completed (sub-) tasks anymore**

No already completed (sub-)tasks are imported anymore – this could happen in some circumstances when the parent task was not completed but (some) subtasks already were

**🐛 fixed edge case for recurring tasks**

previously if an instance of a recurring task was completed in Todoist first, and then in Craft – syncing the task states also completed the next instance of the task in Todoist. This is now fixed – recurring tasks are only completed if the due date matches between Todoist and Craft.

I hope you like this new update 😎
