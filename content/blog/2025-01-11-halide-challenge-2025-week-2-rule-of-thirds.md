[Halide](https://halide.cam) started a great [challenge](https://mastodon.social/@halide/113754547695933024) to complete 52 weeks of shooting to improve photography skills. 

I always enjoyed iPhone photography and especially since I got my iPhone 16 Pro Max I started again shooting in RAW using Halide. This is a great challenge for me to open the eyes more and [capture beauty in the mundane](https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2015/09/03/on-capturing-beauty-in-the-mundane/). I'll make sure to not use old photos but instead go out and shoot something for the challenge each week. I won't commit to post each and every shot here but I'll try my best ðŸ˜Š

The theme of week 2 was **Rule of Thirds** and here is my shot from a walk in our hometown today:
