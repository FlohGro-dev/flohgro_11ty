The theme for the Nth week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Speed**".

There isn’t good weather this week, but today I had to go out to take a shot for the challenge. I thought about how to capture this theme and saw a lot of cool ideas in the Discord. I decided to go with railway tracks, though in our case, it’s a bit ironic. The German railway system isn’t exactly known for speed (or punctuality), but in our hometown, there isn’t even an active railway. These tracks haven’t seen a train for as long as I can remember - except for the occasional historic steam train on some weekends. So, while this is kind of a negative example, I tried to bring a sense of speed into the shot by taking it from a low angle.
