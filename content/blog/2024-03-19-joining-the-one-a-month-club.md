I stumbled across some posts on Mastodon and blogs I follow about „One a Month“. [Jarrod](https://bio.link/jarrod) has set up a cool site for the [One a Month Club](https://oneamonth.club) to round up all sites / people who are following this framework.

[Manuel Morale](https://manuelmorale.com) started that ‘movement’ on his blog saying:

> I recently realized that tiers are the wrong approach. At least for me. I believe in kindness. I believe that if you decide to support something I do, you should get all the benefits, no matter how much you pay.“  
> – Manuel Moreale

I totally agree with his belief in kindness, but as Robb also put it in his [post](https://rknight.me/blog/one-a-month-club/)

> I don’t want to paywall the things I make, those are better served being available to everyone“  
> – Robb Knight

This has always been my approach and people who benefit from things I develop get „nothing“ but the satisfaction of making me smile. Of course there are regular costs (e.g. this website or the great social.lol instance on Mastodon by [omg.lol](https://omg.lol)) but the most expensive thing of course is my own time. I love creating tools and helping people improve and simplify their workflows so I never paywalled these things. On the other hand it’s really great to get some appreciation and a little compensation of the costs.

In short: I added (or changed) membership tiers on my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/flohgro) and [buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/flohgro) to 1$ a month. I also changed the minimum amount to 1$ to join the people Jarrod listed on [oneamonth.club](https://oneamonth.club).

Nothing will change about the stuff I create and share, but if you want to support me on a regular basis, you can do so at the lowest possible cost. I really appreciate every single support I receive, replies / boosts on Mastodon, kind words via email and of course everyone who wants to support _One a Month_.

Thank you!
