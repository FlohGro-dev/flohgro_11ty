Sometimes a small 'meta-action' in Drafts is a real game-changer. 

I create so many actions in Drafts that it's not always easy to find them in the action list. I heavily rely on the [Command Palette](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/drafts/command-palette) to search and run actions buried in the Action Groups.

I needed a quick and easy way to run a few actions from different Action Groups. That's why I created the **[action runner](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2XF)** action.

It's a small action that allows you to configure an action group that it should use. It displays all available actions in a menu and then runs the selected one. I use this to create buttons in my action bar above the keyboard to run often-used actions from different action groups - this makes it unnecessary to use the command palette and speeds things up a bit ðŸ˜Š

I might extend the action to search through all action groups instead of a specific one in the future. 
Hopefully, you can make use of the action runner - if you have any ideas or issues, please let me know.
