The theme for the 7th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Air**".

We had a good time this weekend in the alps blessed with great weather (freezing cold, down to minus 10¬∞C but sunny). On our last day the weather didn't look that good at the bottom but once we took the gondola to the top the sun was shining and we were above the clouds üå§Ô∏è. Took this shot on the way back down into the sea of clouds.

Below, evergreen trees dusted with snow stand tall, framing the ski slope that winds down the mountain. In the distance, additional gondolas move along the cable, disappearing into a soft, misty horizon where the sky meets a blanket of clouds.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-7-air.png)
