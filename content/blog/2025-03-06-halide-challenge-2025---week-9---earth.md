The theme for the Nth week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**earth**".

Originally, I planned to dig my hands into some dirt for this week's challenge, but I forgot to do it when I had the chance, and then I ran out of time to take a photo. While on a walk enjoying the first ice cream from our trusted Gelateria, I came across those lovely crocus buds and decided to ground my iPhone to capture the moment. I really like the contrast between the details in the foreground and the (somewhat) bright background, where you can almost envision the old town buildings peeking through the trees.
