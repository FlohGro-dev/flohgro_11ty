This action queries all your drafts for a specific tag and presents their titles in a prompt. The selected draft will be loaded into the editor

## \[Configuration\]

You need to configure the tag this action should use. To do so, edit this line in the script `const listTag = "ref_list";` and replace _ref\_lists_ with the tag you want to use for your lists.

## \[Usage\]

After you configured the action you can use it to quickly open your most used lists in Drafts.

If you want to add Text to a list you can look at the [Add to List](https://flohgro.com/web/drafts-actions/add-to-list/) Action.
