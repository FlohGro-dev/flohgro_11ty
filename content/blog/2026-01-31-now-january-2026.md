This is my first /now page update. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com), this is what I'm currently up to.

## OnThisDay

I'm working on an app called **OnThisDay** which is currently in TestFlight. The idea is simple but something I've wanted for a long time: it lets you review photos taken on the same day in past years. It's a nice way to resurface memories that would otherwise stay buried in your photo library. I'm refining the experience based on tester feedback and hope to release it soon. [Get in touch](/contactme/) if you want to join.

## CraftWork

I've been building a **Drafts Action Group** that connects [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) with [Craft](https://www.craft.do). The goal is to make it easier to send content between the two apps, leveraging the strengths of both. If you use Drafts for quick capture and Craft for longer-form notes, this action group bridges the gap between them. I actually won a prize for this in the Craft Winter Challenge and you can find my submission document [here](https://craft.flohgro.com/66Ubl1B526lowv). I am slowly adding a few smaller things to it.

## House Renovation

We moved into a house last year and there is still some renovation work to do. Finishing our bedroom, planning a new bathroom, and a roof renovation are the
big projects for this year.

## Youth Work & Volunteering

In a couple of weeks the registrations for our camps in the summer will start and they require some preparations. There are some new things we want to tackle this year - exciting times.

I'm preparing a talk about the first three of [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.franklincovey.com/books/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/) for a bigger event in our youth work organisation. I want to share a few things that will hopefully help others to get more done and stop fighting fires all the time.

## Super Bowl LX

I’m excited for the Patriots being back in Super Bowl LX against the Seahawks! Can’t wait for game day—I hope the Patriots are gonna make it!

We all we got. We all we need!
