The theme for the 17th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "** Angles**".

On a short weekend trip I was always on the lookout for some great angles for the challenge. When our little boy resisted to sleep in the car we were forced to take a break and walk around for a while during the sunset. When I found this sculpture I thought it would be a great alternative take on the challenge. It shows different angles of the same building in the same image due to the effect of the light breaking in the sphere.

The sculpture is set against a vibrant pink and purple sunset sky, with a brick building and tree branches visible in the background. The brick building is mirrored in the sphere.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-17-angles.jpeg)
