This action sorts a list of checkboxes based on their state. All done items will be moved to the end of the draft into the section titled with „_\## done_“

## \[Configuration\]

_no configuration needed_

## \[Usage\]

Use this action when you have a checklist open and don’t want to delete done items with the clean done items in list action but instead move them into a „_\## done_“ section. You can use the [Show List](https://flohgro.com/web/drafts-actions/show-list/) action to open your lists quickly.
