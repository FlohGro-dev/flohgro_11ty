The theme for the 21st week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Sunset**".

While I love the longer days in the summer, this theme is a bit challenging right now with our little boy. He usually goes to bed somewhere between 19:00 and 20:00 (7 to 8 p.m.). Thatâ€™s why I seldom get the chance to get a good view of the sunset around here. Today, my wife was away, and I went for a walk to get him to sleep (it worked, in case you wondered), and when I passed these trees with the sun in the back shortly before golden hour, I took a few shots that I quite enjoyed. The saturated green colors all around are just great at the end of the spring season.

Beyond the tree, a sun-dappled field stretches out, bathed in the warm golden hues of the setting sun. A narrow dirt path runs along the field, and a line of trees borders the horizon under a soft, glowing sky.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-21-sunset.jpeg)
