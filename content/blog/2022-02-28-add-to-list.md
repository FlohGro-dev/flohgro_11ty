This action adds the content of the current draft to the list draft you select in a prompt. The content will be added after a checkbox. You can also create a list for a new topic from the prompt.

## \[Configuration\]

You need to configure the tag this action should use. To do so, edit this line in the script `const listTag = "ref_list";` and replace _ref\_lists_ with the tag you want to use for your lists.

## \[Usage\]

After you configured the action you can add the content of the current open draft to one of your lists. If you want to create a new list for a topic just select _CREATE NEW LIST_ and insert the name for the list. The action will automatically create the new list and add the content to it.
