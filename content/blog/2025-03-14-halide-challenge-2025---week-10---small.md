The theme for the 10th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Small**".

This theme has a lot of potential, and you can be very creative with it. One member in the Halide Discord took a great shot of his small boy captured in a droplet on a blade of grass (awesome shot!). My initial thoughts were also about shooting something with our baby boy, but when I went to donate blood today, I felt like this would be a little unexpected but also fit the theme very well.

Donating blood is a small thing you can do to help people in need. Every day, 14,000 blood donations are needed in Germany alone for emergency assistance in the event of accidents, cancer therapy, planned operations, and also for immune diseases. This half-hour act is something I can easily do every two months to help around three people who need blood donations for their health. A small thing I can do to have a huge impact.

If you're able, consider donating blood â€“ it can make a huge difference.

A tube is connected to the needle, drawing blood. A gauze pad rests on the arm, and a tourniquet is fastened around the upper arm.
