The theme for the 8th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Reflections**".

My photo is probably an easy solution to the theme because reflections in the water are an obvious choice. I did some experiments with reflections of lights in our windows but wasn't satisfied with the end result. On a bike ride on the weekend, I had to stop at this small lake with calm water perfectly mirroring this tiny forest. I couldn't resist taking this as my submission for this weekâ€™s theme, even if it is an obvious choice.

The trees are situated on a small strip of land, and their reflection creates a symmetrical effect on the water. In the background, there are a few houses partially visible among the trees, under a clear blue sky.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-8-reflections.png)
