The theme for the 16th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Curves**".

I went for a walk today with our little one, keeping an eye out for something to capture for this week’s topic. There were a few contenders, but the spontaneous shot of the historic stairs, with their sharp shadows in the upper half, won me over. These stairs are quite worn, and walking on them gives you a bit of a dizzy feeling 😵‍💫.

Bright sunlight casts sharp, angular shadows on the steps, highlighting their irregular texture and creating an optical illusion effect. The stairs lead upward into a sunlit area, suggesting an ancient or historic structure.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-16-theme.png)
