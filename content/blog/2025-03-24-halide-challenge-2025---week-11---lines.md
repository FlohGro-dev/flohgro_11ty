The theme for the 11th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Lines**".

I have to admit that I'm a bit confused about the schedule of the challenges - We're now in CW 13 but the challenge is number 11 ðŸ˜† 

Nevertheless after the new theme came in we were on a short bike ride and during a break a used the 5x lens to shoot the corner of this weathered wooden barn in a small village. I had to crop it even further to get rid of some car roofs in front of it. I found the different directions of the lines from the wooden walls and the fiber cement roof a very good fit for the theme.

When viewed with Night Shift and True Tone the sky seems to be a bit purple which was definitely not the case.. I edit these raw images with [Photomator](https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/) on iOS and I disable Nnight Shift and True Tone with a shortcut automation to ensure I don't make my edits using color filters on the iPhone. Sometimes this causes such results in the end.

I wasn't sure if it would be good to crop it even further (e.g. into a square format) but ultimately decided to keep it as it is now.
