The theme for the 18th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Street**".

It was difficult to get a shot in time for me this week. When I was on the road I forgot to shoot something. I also wanted to dive deeper into what the Halide team posted in the Discord about "Garry Winogrand" and "Vivian Maier" to maybe try to shoot in a style of those photographers but simply I didn't had the time to.

Since time is running out (I think ðŸ¤”) for this week this is my submission to the challenge. The current construction work in the old town in black and white.

The ground is dug up with deep trenches, surrounded by construction barriers and machinery, including an excavator with a visible 'CAT' logo. Traditional / historic, multi-story buildings with gabled roofs and shuttered windows line the background.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-challenge-2025-week-18-street.jpeg)
