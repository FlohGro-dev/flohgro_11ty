The theme for the 4th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Blue Hour**".

Given the current weather it's a hit or miss to get a good shot before sunrise or after sunset. This week was additionally difficult due to tight schedules so I wasn't able to get out during sunset times. Today I managed to take a short walk through the city during blue hour and took a few shots. Skimming through my options I somehow liked the simplicity in my submission for week 4.
