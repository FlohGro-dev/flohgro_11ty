This shortcut lets you open the daily note you select (yesterday, today or tomorrow).  
You have to set the space in every of the „open document“ actions since this is currently the only way to open a daily note you select directly

## \[Configuration\]

When you install the shortcut you are prompted to select the space the shortcut should use. Unfortunately you need to select the space Id three times right now.

## \[Usage\]

Use this shortcut to quickly open the daily note from your homescreen or anywhere else.
