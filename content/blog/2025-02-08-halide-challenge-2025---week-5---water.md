The theme for the Nth week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Water**".

This week was a real challenge for me, but it forced me to do some experiments. I had a tight schedule, and I didn't want to "just" shoot a river or small pond/lake. So, I experimented a bit with the water resistance of the iPhone and took some shots in the sink with no success. I tried to shoot something in the shower, but this was also a bad idea. Putting a drop of water onto the lenses also didn't work out very well. So, in the end, I submitted this shot of a water droplet on our table that reflects the sun and the iPhone lenses in it. I made use of the excellent macro mode in Halide to get the focus close enough. Given the way this week went, I'm still happy that I could still publish a shot and continue with the challenge.
