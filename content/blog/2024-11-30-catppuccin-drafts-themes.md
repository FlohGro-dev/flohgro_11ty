I took some time to create some [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) themes inspired by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com). I already enjoy using the Mocha theme in VS Code so it was only a matter of time to finally create one for my favorite app.

I did my best to stick to the style-guide and I think they turned out great! Check them out and let me know if you like them.
