The theme for the 12th week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Weather**".

It was again a lot going on this week, and while I thought about the challenge topic a few times, I didn't shoot a lot. During a longer drive, I thought that I have to capture something related to the wind because we have some quite windy days right now. Therefore, I took a small detour and shot that wind turbine during the evening hours. I'm quite happy with the result, and cranking up the texture made it look even more dramatic. ðŸ˜Š

Fields of grass and crops flank the road, with a line of trees visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky.]({{ baseUrl }}/assets/halide-photo-challenge-week-12-weather.png)
