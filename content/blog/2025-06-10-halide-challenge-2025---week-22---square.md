The theme for the 22nd week of the [Halide](https://halide.cam) challenge in 2025 is "**Square**".

We are renovating a house. The theme of the week came at the right time after we removed the tiles from the old bathroom. The uneven mortar on the edgy wall immediately came to mind after reading the theme, perhaps also because I was seeing it all day while removing the tiles. ðŸ˜€
