This shortcut just creates a link to the todays note for Craft and outputs it.  
It’s useful to integrate in other shortcuts with a “Run Shortcut” action where you want to have the todays date in a text.

## \[Configuration\]

_no configuration needed_

## \[Usage\]

If you want to e.g. build a shortcut to log something like gratefulness in a document in Craft and include a link to the current daily note in it just include this shortcut with a “Run Shortcut” Action in the one you are building.  
Then you can easily use the output of that shortcut in a text step and add the content to a document in Craft. The Text will then contain a link to the daily note.
