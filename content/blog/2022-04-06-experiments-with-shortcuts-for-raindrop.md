**Update:** Turns out that you can use the highlight colors in raindrop to create more structured highlights in the markdown export. I always struggled using highlights since it was necessary to format them in the export to sort them e.g. below the heading they belong to. Now I just use the colors yellow > blue > green > red to set the level of indentation.

- modified version of [Get Raindrop Highlights from last document](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f63456a9d8f04965be4dc235b3757861)

- If you’re using Craft you can immediately create a new document from this shortcut: [latest Raindrop Highlights to Craft](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e406e1a63bbe415f9a4e07c2d0a817eb)

I experimented a bit with the newly released highlights feature of [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io).  
I wanted to see if there is a quick and easy to use solution to import the highlights of my most recently highlighted bookmark into markdown format.  
With [Raindrops API](https://developer.raindrop.io) this is possible and can be used in Shortcuts!

I built two Shortcuts I want to share with you. The first creates a markdown text for the most recently highlighted bookmark.  
The second Shortcut will import all Highlights made today and sort them by their source into a nice overview. This second shortcut requires the [Toolbox Pro App](https://toolboxpro.app).  
Download them here:

This was just an experiment and its not too easy to retrieve a authentication token but it works – if you’re interested I can document this a bit to make it easier to create your own token for your raindrop account
