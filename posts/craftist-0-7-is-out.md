Another step forward for my Craft eXtension to integrate with Todoist.

Find all the details below 📝 and download ⬇️ the new release from the GitHub repository:  
https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/Craftist  
After installing it you have to Login again with your Todoist token  
If you have question’s / ideas or issues let me know 📮

**Priorities Import 🔴🟠🔵⚪️**

The priorities of your tasks are imported from Todoist as metadata. The imported priorities will be highlighted similar to the colors in todoist as p1🔴/p2🟠/p3🔵/p4⚪️  
Of course you can disable the import in the settings

**Sync Task Improvements 🔧**

I completely reworked the behavior to make it much cleaner (e.g. no deleting and re-adding of task blocks)  
The sync of Recurring Tasks was improved again – they will now be “unlinked” in daily notes to prevent completing tasks several times

**Fixed Task formattings 🩹**

I improved the handling of formatted tasks (e.g. with markdown links or bold / italic styling) these should be preserved now and don’t get lost after creation or sync

**CONTINUOUS TASK SYNC (beta) 🔁**

Please provide feedback on that in the [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/Craftist/discussions/45)

It can be enabled in the settings.  
The Sync Task Button will then enable / disable the continuous sync of tasks every <sub>30</sub> seconds.

I hope you like this update 😎  
The repository now contains several discussions where you can provide feedback if you want – this will help me to decide future development and feature priorization
