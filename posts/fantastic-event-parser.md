I extended the awesome _Fantastically Good Event Parser_ by @pdavisonreiber (original [Drafts forum post](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/fantastically-good-event-parser/1745?u=flohgro) and [action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Lk)) to allow the users more control over the actually created event.

It uses the same parsing technique so full credits to @pdavisonreiber for that logic! I added a prompt for each event the action will create where you can check the interpreted data and make adjustments if you want to.

I included an extended documentation on how to use the action in the directory. A few examples of events that will be recognized by the action:

```
Important discussion with coworkers tomorrow 9:00-11:30 /work alert 30min at Apple Park
Dinner sunday 19:00 for 3h /private at FavoritePizza
Workshop 2024-02-01 to 2024-02-03 /work at San Francisco
Call with Somebody today 17:00
```

Find the documentation and download it in the action directory

If you want to discuss about the action head over to the [Drafts forum](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/fantastic-event-parser/14766?u=flohgro). I also posted about it on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@flohgro/111623974163344208) – let me know what you think ☺️
