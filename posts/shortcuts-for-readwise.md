After trying [Readwise Reader](https://read.readwise.io) and experimenting a bit with the [Readwise](https://readwise.io) trial I subscribed to the service because its just great 😄.

Now I tried to create a few Shortcuts to retrieve Highlights from Readwise and share them to other apps. I personally use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and Readwise has a great official plugin to import the highlights but I couldn’t resist to built the Shortcuts anyways.

Below are the Shortcuts I created. If you have feedback, further requests, or trouble just reach out on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@flohgro). If you like the Shortcuts I would appreciate if you share this post and consider to [support my work](https://flohgro.com/donate/)

## App-Specific Versions

Below are a few App-specific Versions of the Shortcuts above. The exported Highlights will direclty be exported to those apps instead of opening the Share Sheet. If you don’t find the App your using, either modify them yourself or reach out and I’ll add them.
