Sometimes you need a fresh paint for apps you use the most. The great thing about [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) is that themes can totally change the look (and feel) of the app especially when you assign them to different workspaces.

Having used my [Vivid Black+ themes](https://directory.getdrafts.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Vivid+Black) for a long time I was in the mood for some more colors in the interface. That’s why I took the time to create a series of c\[olor\]ed themes that I enjoy using for different workspaces to easily distinguish which one is active right now. It started with six themes but I already added a 7th theme to the list after a user in the [Drafts forum thread](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/c-olor-ed-themes/14513?u=flohgro).

Take a look at these great themes

If your interested to try them you can download them in the Drafts directory:

- [cBlued](https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/2MO)
- [cGreened](https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/2MP)
- [cMastodoned](https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/2MQ)
- [cMinted](https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/2MR)
- [cOrange](https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/2ML)
- [cRed](https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/2MS)
- [cYellowed](https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/2M6)

To assign a them to a workspace edit the workspace, scroll down and pick the theme you like as preferred theme.
