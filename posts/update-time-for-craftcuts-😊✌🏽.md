My eXtension to integrate your Craft Contents with any App that supports Shortcuts got some new convenience features 🙌🏽

##### 🆕 tab layout 🖌️

just like Craftist the new tab Lay-out divides the layout into _Shortcuts_ and _Info_

##### 🆕 Info tab ℹ️ with Version Check ✅

The new info tab checks if the installed version is the latest available version and displays some informative text.

(Again) Thanks to @DharamKapila for the inspiration, help and permission here!

##### 🆕 editable Shortcut configurations ⚙️

Every configured Shortcut can now be edited in place with the edit button on the right. No need to remove and add a Shortcut again when you made a false configuration or you want to change something

##### 🆕 movable Shortcuts ↕️

You can now move the Shortcuts up and down in the edit menu – so you can manually sort your Shortcuts to your personal preference

##### 🐛 validation fixes

in some edge cases the validation was not rejecting an unsupported configuration of input parameters for shortcuts – not anymore

Download ⏬ the new version from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/Craftcuts) and reinstall it in Craft

⚠️ unfortunately you have to add the Shortcuts you already configured in Craftcuts again after the update (due to API limitations) ⚠️

I hope you like these _quality of life_ imrpovements 😊

Let me know if you have additional usecases, compatible Shortcuts you’d like to share or issues with Craftcuts

Have a great day 😉
